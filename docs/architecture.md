# Architecture

Here are some clues that should help you get started.

## Component interaction diagram

Here is a high-level overview of the interaction between V-Mail's components:

        API(V-Mail Go API)
        DB(Postgres DB)
        MC(mailcow Server)
    end

    User -- " 3. Load App " --> FE

    API -- " 6. Read/Write Cache " --> DB
    API -- " 7. Sync (IMAP) / Search (IMAP) / Send (SMTP) " --> MC

## DB

We chose **Postgres** for its robustness, reliability, and excellent support for `JSONB`,
which is useful for flexible payloads like our action queue.

The DB's role is **not** to be a full, permanent copy of the mailbox. Its primary roles are:

* Caching thread/message metadata for a fast UI.
* Storing user settings and their **encrypted** IMAP/SMTP credentials.
* Saving drafts.
* Queuing actions (like "Undo Send" or offline operations).

## Back end

The back end is a **Go** application providing a **REST API** for the front end.
It communicates with the IMAP and the SMTP server and uses a **Postgres** database for caching and internal storage.

### Go libraries used

* **IMAP Client:** [`github.com/emersion/go-imap`](https://github.com/emersion/go-imap)
    * This seems to be the *de facto* standard library for client-side IMAP in Go.
      It seems well-maintained and supports the necessary extensions like `THREAD`.
* **MIME Parsing:** [`github.com/jhillyerd/enmime`](https://github.com/jhillyerd/enmime)
    * The Go standard library is not enough for real-world, complex emails.
    * `enmime` robustly handles attachments, encodings,
      and HTML/text parts. [Docs here.](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jhillyerd/enmime)
* **SMTP Sending:** Standard `net/smtp` (for transport)
  with [`github.com/go-mail/mail`](https://github.com/go-mail/mail)
    * `net/smtp` is the standard library for sending.
    * `go-mail` is a popular and simple builder library for composing complex emails (HTML and attachments)
      that `net/smtp` can then send.
* **HTTP Router:** [`http.ServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux)
    * It's part of the Go standard library, is battle-tested and well-documented.
    * Selected based on [this guide](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/which-go-router-should-i-use)
* **Postgres Driver:** [`github.com/jackc/pgx`](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)
    * The modern, high-performance Postgres driver for Go. We need no full ORM (like [GORM](https://gorm.io/))
      for this project.
* **Encryption:** Standard `crypto/aes` and `crypto/cipher`
    * For encrypting/decrypting user credentials in the DB using AES-GCM.
* **Testing:** [`github.com/ory/dockertest`](https://github.com/ory/dockertest)
    * Useful for integration tests to spin up real Postgres containers.

### REST API

**Base path:** `/api/v1`

**Thread ID:** The `thread_id` we use in the API (e.g., `/api/v1/thread/{thread_id}`) is a stable,
unique identifier, such as the `Message-ID` header of the root/first message in the thread.

* [x] `GET /auth/status`: Checks the Authelia token and tells the front end if the user is authenticated, and has
  completed the setup/onboarding.
    * Response: `{"isSetupComplete": false}`.
    * `isSetupComplete: false` tells the React app to redirect to the `/settings` page for onboarding.
* [ ] `GET /folders`: List all IMAP folders (Inbox, Sent, etc.).
* [ ] `GET /threads?folder=Inbox&page=1&limit=100`: Get paginated threads for a folder.
* [ ] `GET /threads/search?q=from:george&page=1`: Get paginated search results.
* [ ] `GET /thread/{thread_id}`: Get all messages and content for one thread.
* [ ] `GET /message/{message_id}/attachment/{attachment_id}`: Download an attachment.
* [x] `GET /settings`: Get user settings.
    * Response: `{"imap_server_hostname": "mail.example.com", "archive_folder_name": "Archive", ...}`
    * It should **not** return the encrypted passwords.
* [ ] `POST /send`: Send a new email (places in `action_queue` for "Undo Send").
* [ ] `POST /drafts`: Create or update a draft.
* [ ] `POST /actions`: Perform bulk actions.
    * Body: `{"action": "archive", "thread_ids": ["id1", "id2"]}`
    * Body: `{"action": "mark_read", "message_ids": ["id3"]}`
    * Body: `{"action": "star", "thread_ids": ["id1"]}`
* [ ] `POST /undo`: Undo the last `send` action.
* [x] `POST /settings`: Save settings.
    * Body:
      `{"imap_server_hostname": "imap.example.com", "imap_username": "user", "imap_password": "pass", "smtp_server_hostname": "smtp.example.com", "smtp_username": "user", "smtp_password": "pass", "undo_send_delay_seconds": 20, "pagination_threads_per_page": 100}`
    * Response: `200 OK`
* [ ] `DELETE /threads`: Move threads to trash.
    * Body: `{"thread_ids": ["id1", "id2"]}`

### Real-time API (WebSockets)

For real-time updates (like new emails), the front end will open a WebSocket connection.

* `GET /api/v1/ws`: Upgrades the HTTP connection to a WebSocket.
  The server uses this connection to push updates to the client.
    * **Server-to-client message example:**
        ```json
        {"type": "new_message", "folder": "INBOX"}
        ```

## Front end

### Tech

* **Framework:** React 19+, with functional components and hooks.
* **Language:** TypeScript, using no classes, just modules.
* **Styling:** Tailwind 4, utility-first CSS.
* **Package manager:** pnpm.
* **State management:**
    * `TanStack Query` (React Query): For server state (caching, invalidating, and refetching all data from our Go API).
    * `Zustand`: For simple, global UI state (e.g., current selection, composer open/closed).
* **Routing:** `react-router` (for URL-based navigation, e.g., `/inbox`, `/thread/id`).
* **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier.
* **Testing:**
    * `Jest` + `React Testing Library`: For unit and integration tests.
    * `Playwright`: For end-to-end tests.
* **Security:** [`DOMPurify`](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)
    * To sanitize all email HTML content before rendering it with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
      This is a **mandatory** security step.
