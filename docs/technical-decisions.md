### Go libraries used

* **IMAP Client:** [`github.com/emersion/go-imap`](https://github.com/emersion/go-imap)
    * This seems to be the *de facto* standard library for client-side IMAP in Go.
      It seems well-maintained and supports the necessary extensions like `THREAD`.
* **MIME Parsing:** [`github.com/jhillyerd/enmime`](https://github.com/jhillyerd/enmime)
    * The Go standard library is not enough for real-world, complex emails.
    * `enmime` robustly handles attachments, encodings,
      and HTML/text parts. [Docs here.](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jhillyerd/enmime)
* **SMTP Sending:** Standard `net/smtp` (for transport)
  with [`github.com/go-mail/mail`](https://github.com/go-mail/mail)
    * `net/smtp` is the standard library for sending.
    * `go-mail` is a popular and simple builder library for composing complex emails (HTML and attachments)
      that `net/smtp` can then send.
* **HTTP Router:** [`http.ServeMux`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux)
    * It's part of the Go standard library, is battle-tested and well-documented.
    * Selected based on [this guide](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/which-go-router-should-i-use)
* **Postgres Driver:** [`github.com/jackc/pgx`](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)
    * The modern, high-performance Postgres driver for Go. We need no full ORM (like [GORM](https://gorm.io/))
      for this project.
* **Encryption:** Standard `crypto/aes` and `crypto/cipher`
    * For encrypting/decrypting user credentials in the DB using AES-GCM.
* **Testing:** [`github.com/ory/dockertest`](https://github.com/ory/dockertest)
    * Useful for integration tests to spin up real Postgres containers.

## Front end

### Tech

* **Framework:** React 19+, with functional components and hooks.
* **Language:** TypeScript, using no classes, just modules.
* **Styling:** Tailwind 4, utility-first CSS.
* **Package manager:** pnpm.
* **State management:**
    * `TanStack Query` (React Query): For server state (caching, invalidating, and refetching all data from our Go API).
    * `Zustand`: For simple, global UI state (e.g., current selection, composer open/closed).
* **Routing:** `react-router` (for URL-based navigation, e.g., `/inbox`, `/thread/id`).
* **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier.
* **Testing:**
    * `Jest` + `React Testing Library`: For unit and integration tests.
    * `Playwright`: For end-to-end tests.
* **Security:** [`DOMPurify`](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)
    * To sanitize all email HTML content before rendering it with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
      This is a **mandatory** security step.
