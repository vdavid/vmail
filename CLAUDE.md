Before touching the repo, make sure you've read:
- the main [README.md](README.md)
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [docs/style-guide](docs/style-guide.md)

Then read any other docs you might need as you go, for example, [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) if you touch tests.

Always keep the dev process and style guide in mind.
